# Retrospective week 6

### What we have done in this sprint
This was kind of a weird sprint, since it spanned over the christmas break, we said
that we would do quite a lot of things, this can be seen in milestones for week 6.1.
However, we didn't do all of those things resulting in a stressful period for the final weeks of the project.

### What can be improved
We should have set more realistic goals for the holiday, since everyone also just wanted a break.
And not more studying and programming to do.
