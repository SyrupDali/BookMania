# Main problems during week 2

## Problem 1
### Description: 
Didn't submit our requirements draft on time,
this caused us to receive limited feedback on it
### Future adjustments
Check the deadlines more frequently and double check that we've uploaded what needed to be uploaded


## Problem 2
### Description
We had some messy meetings, there wasn't really a structure in the meetings.
This lead to us having to spend more time on things. We were going back and forth between persons, it took a lot of time to make a decision
Another side effect of this, is that not everyone was able to speak as often during the meeting
### Future adjustments
Make clear plans for a meeting beforehand such that the meeting keeps a nice structure and everyone is working on the same thing.
The chairman should keep people on track for the agenda, and that everyone has given their opinion on the topic.
